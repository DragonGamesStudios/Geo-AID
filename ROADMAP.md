# Assigned

Changes that are already assigned to specific versions.

# Backlog

Will do, but yet unassigned.

- It's always more docs
- Quantum points
- More engines (?)
- GeoGebra drawer
- Extraction of drawers to external crates (will help with e.g. reusing the code for a browser-based interface to
  Geo-AID)
- A simple equation solver, crucial for handling distance literals well.
- Label support for circles, lines, etc. including smart label assignment for distances.
- Distance and angle equality support (for the presentation layer, the rules have always supported it)
- More expressions: transforms, trigonometry, working with complex numbers
- More language sugars: Triangles, polygons, etc.
- More rules: lying inside a shape, rules regarding areas, lying "on the other side" to another point.
- Math stage should detect repetition and contradiction, along with some basic automatic theorem checking.

# Ideas

Maybe some day...

- Stereometry (3d)
- Colors on figures
- Web interface
- Statement to script translator
- Couple the above with OCR
- Browser plugin for problem detection
- Working with pdfs
- Marketing, I guess (blog?)

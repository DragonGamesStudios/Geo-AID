# Operators

Standard arithmetic operations - addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`) are only
allowed between numbers. Addition and subtraction must only be performed between numbers of the same unit, whereas
multiplication and division can be done with any two numbers. The resulting unit will simply be a product of the operation.
Beyond that, negation with the `-` operator can be performed on any number.
